# HigherOrderFunction
learning Javascript higher order functions

Javascript has a built in function called forEach()
This function performs a user defined function for each element in the array.
I'm going to write my own forEach() function, to practise writing higher order functions.

Step 1.
Write a 'simple' functions that manipulates every element of an array in a 'fixed' way.

Step 2.
To be more flexible, substitute the simple function with a higer order function.
This higher order takes another function as an argument.
This other function defines the manipulation on each array element.
